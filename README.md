# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ali SABOURI
### student of EEE | Computer Programmer

This is AliSBR,
A computer programmer,EEE&CS Stduent and tech enthusiast.
I started programming before high school with Python.
In high school, I founded a robotics team for my school and began learning C++. After a while, I needed C# for some projects and learned that as well.
I enjoy contributing creatively when working on robotics projects.

I officially started working in the industry at the age of 17, joining a company. In my first official experience, I learned the APEX language.
After that, I worked with C# and the .NET framework for about 1.5 years.

My most significant professional experience so far has been working with PHP at Webticari, where I was part of a great team.

As a freelancer, I develop web projects using JavaScript (React and Next.js) and ASP.NET. I also build mobile applications using Java and Kotlin.
